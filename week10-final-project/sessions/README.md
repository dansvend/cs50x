#### Description
As a Software Developer I have flexibility around my working hours. When COVID hit and made a lot of people work remotely I noticed that it was easy to loose track of my work hours. My workday became scattered. I was working late nights and early mornings. A lot of work happened outside of core working hours. This gave me an idea to solve this problem by building an application.

The application would keep track of when work sessions start and when when they end. By just maintaining a small amount of data the app could show a lot of useful information. Work hours could be easily be summed up for a day, a week, a month etc. By using this app in my everyday life it will make it easy for me to see ways to improve the user experience and fix bugs. By finishing the final project I am motivated to make this into a proper app on the App Store and/or to deploy this fullstack application to a hosting service like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services or Heroku. I will start with a free account and give the link to friends to see if they find it useful and get user feedback which will push the application in the right direction. My ultimate goal is to make this into a business and let the masses get value from the application, simplifying peoples lives by keeping track of work sessions in a structured way. I hope people find value in it. I think that the app has potential to add values to people lives and I have a lot of ideas to feature to implement in the future.

For this version of the app I built a web application consisting of a sqlite3 database, Python as the server side language using the Jinja templating language. On the client side I used HTML, CSS by utilizing Bootstrap as well as JavaScript to make the app dynamic. I will definately use Bootstrap in a future project as it makes it easy to implement mobile first responsive design for web applications and websites. During my work on this final project implementing my core features I stumbled upon a lot of edge cases which needed to be taken care of. I broke the edge cases into smaller problems which I was able to solve one at the time. Googling stuff is a necessity and proves the great value that Google has for programmers as well as other fields when solving problems. After having learnt the fundamentals of programming you know what to search when solving problems in any language. I learnt how important the planning and design phase of a project is to avoid having to implement a feature several times by trial and error. This is valuable experiences which I will bring with me into my next project.

Thank you so much for reading this and thank you to everyone on the CS50 team who made this course available online for the masses. This course have given me a lot of newfound knowledge and has given me a solid foundation to further develop my skills as a Software Developer and a problem solver.
